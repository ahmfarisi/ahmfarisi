# About me

Hi ! I am Ahmad Farisi. I am a university lecturer in my hometown, Palembang, South Sumatera, Indonesia. I am teaching some programming subject and courses, such as **mobile application programming using java, programming basics using python and C, and web programming using PHP CodeIgniter.** 

I am very enthusiastic about software management project and startup, especially about the SCRUM and Kanban Methodology. Right now, I am still learning more about type script.

So, let's collaborate and grow together.
