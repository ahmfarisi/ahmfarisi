# About me

Hi! I’m Ahmad Farisi, a university lecturer from Palembang, South Sumatera, Indonesia. I’m really passionate about helping students succeed by using creative teaching methods and offering support through mentorship. I love seeing students grow and reach their potential, both in the classroom and beyond.

Besides teaching, I’m also really into research—especially in areas like information systems and software engineering. I enjoy working on projects that use tech to solve real-world problems, and I’m always open to collaborating with others to push ideas forward.

I’m all about continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in education and technology, and I’m always looking for ways to make a positive impact in both fields.
